Phytoplankton are microorganisms that make up the base of the food web and a major sink for atmospheric carbon. Their growth depends on the environmental conditions in the sea surface, and is thus likely to be affected by ongoing environmental changes. 

My research has focused on constraining how climate change affects phytoplankton composition and size structure on seasonal, interannual, or pluriannual timescales. My recent projects have focused on sediment trap series from the NW Mediterranean Sea, and a coastal series of sea surface samples off the coast of Peru.
