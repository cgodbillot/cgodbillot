Biomineralisation—the process by which living organisms create minerals—comes in an incredible variety of shapes and patterns. However, the mechanisms behind mineral formation and the reasons driving it remain largely unconstrained. 

Under environmental stress, organisms can undergo changes in their biomineralisation, with consequences on the chemical composition of the minerals. For instance, it has been suggested that an increase in the biomineralising rates of coccolithophores can lead these unicellular organisms to incorporate strontium into their shells when calcium availability becomes limited. These changes have important consequences on global biogeochemical cycles, but can also bias the paleoclimate reconstructions that rely on geochemical proxies. 

Throughout my career, I have been involved in a number of studies exploring the processes of mineral formation in different key groups of marine organisms, and how these processes affect the chemical signature (or "vital effects") of these minerals.
