Each microfossil has a unique geochemical composition, likely to yield information on the conditions in at the sea surface when it formed. Due to their minute size, their extraction from sediments remains a scientific challenge. 

Multiple microseparation techniques exist, some of which I experimented with during my PhD. An emerging field of study in microseparations is the use of microfluidics to isolate micro-objects from a sample. In 2025, together with colleagues from [the MANTA team at CEREGE](https://github.com/microfossil) and at the FEMTO-ST lab in Besan√ßon (France), we obtained funding to start experimenting with these technologies for microfossil extractions.
